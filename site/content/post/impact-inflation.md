Inflation can have a significant impact on salaries. When the cost of living increases, workers may demand higher wages to maintain their standard of living. Employers may respond by raising salaries, but they may also seek to keep costs down by only offering small raises or none at all.

If inflation is high and wages are not adjusted accordingly, the purchasing power of workers' earnings will decrease. This means that their salaries will not be able to buy as much as they could before, and they may find it harder to afford things like housing, food, and healthcare.

In situations where wages are not keeping pace with inflation, workers may experience what is known as "real wage stagnation" or even a "real wage decline" , this in turn can lead to a decrease in standard of living.

Moreover, the inflation itself can impact businesses and their ability to sustain their revenue, which can affect the hiring plans and could lead to layoffs or freeze in the hiring and salary increases.
